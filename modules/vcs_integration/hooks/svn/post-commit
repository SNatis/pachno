# Please refer to the module documentation for installation instructions
# At the very least, please modify the paths for the direct PHP call or the
# wget method, and comment/uncomment as applicable the method of access you
# will be using. If you are going to use the wget method, please set a passkey
# in module configuration, and set it here (replacing PASSKEY_HERE below).
#
# This hook has been contributed by Philip Kent (lsproc), one of Pachno
# developers.
